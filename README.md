# Taurus olson's emacs configuration file

This configuration uses *org-babel* to expose the Emacs file as a (hopefully)
more readable and documented org-mode file. It's heavily based on
[hrs's configuration](https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles).

As a long-time Vim user, Emacs keybindings have always been very unintuitive to
me so I tried to bring some of my favourite editor keybindings and behaviours using
[evil](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil).
